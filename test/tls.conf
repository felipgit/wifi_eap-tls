#   Test configuration for FreeRadius with eap-tls
#   Steps to test:
#   - Start with copying this file to the ./backup dir
#   - Run ./scripts/start_management.sh to get a shell in the container
#   - Copy the tls.conf file to /root
#   - Run in /scripts: ./manageclients.sh add localhost 127.0.0.1 testing123
#   - Run in /scripts: ./manageusers.sh add testpc - - 10 -
#   - Edit tls.conf: user password and private key (/provision/testpc.p12)
#   - Exit the container to reload config. Get a shell in the container again
#   - Run eapol_test -c /root/tls.conf -s testing123
#   - This command should return SUCCESS
