# Backup of FreeRadius configuration

The configuration of the FreeRadius server is stored on a docker volume. A backup of this data can be made by running the provided backup.sh script:
- Run `./scripts/start_management.sh` as root (or with sudo) in the main directory of this repository
- Run `./backup.sh`
- Close the shell

This creates a backup file in the backup directory. The file name of the backup file includes the date. Only the latest backup made on a specific date is kept. It is recommended to store the backup file and the `.env` file in a secure place offline. Warnings:
- This file contains all passwords and key's used to protect your Wifi network including the secret key for the Certificate Authority!
- The clean.sh script deletes the docker volume for FreeRadius and the backup files. Store backup's offline.

# Restore of FreeRadius configuration

The configuration is restored automatically when at container startup the docker volume is not populated and a backup file is available in the backup directory. The original .env file should also be placed in the root of the root of this repository. The most recent backup is selected. The provision directory is also restored. This data is also available in the `/etc/raddb/certs` directory. Passwords are kept in `passwords.txt`
